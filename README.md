Zipline
=======

Zipline is a Pythonic algorithmic trading library.
The system is fundamentally event-driven and a close
approximation of how live-trading systems operate.
Currently, backtesting is well supported, but the intent is
to develop the library for both paper and live trading,
so that the same logic used for backtesting can be applied
to the market.

Zipline is currently used in production as the backtesting engine
powering Quantopian (https://www.quantopian.com) -- a free, community-centered
platform that allows development and real-time backtesting of trading
algorithms in the web browser.

Discussion and Help
===================

Discussion of the project is held at the Google Group,

Features
========

* Ease of use: Zipline tries to get out of your way so that you can
focus on algorithm development. See below for a code example.

* Zipline comes "batteries included" as many common statistics like
moving average and linear regression can be readily accessed from
within a user-written algorithm.

* Input of historical data and output of performance statistics is
based on Pandas DataFrames to integrate nicely into the existing
Python eco-system.

* Statistic and machine learning libraries like matplotlib, scipy,
statsmodels, and sklearn support development, analysis and
visualization of state-of-the-art trading systems.

Installation
============

Since zipline is pure-python code it should be very easy to install
and set up with pip:

```
pip install numpy   # Pre-install numpy to handle dependency chain quirk
pip install zipline
```

If there are problems installing the dependencies or zipline we
recommend installing these packages via some other means. For Windows,
the [Enthought Python Distribution](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php)
includes most of the necessary dependencies. On OSX, the
[Scipy Superpack](http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/)
works very well.

Dependencies
------------

* Python (>= 2.7.2)
* numpy (>= 1.6.0)
* pandas (>= 0.9.0)
* pytz
* Logbook
* requests
* [python-dateutil](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil) (>= 2.1)


Conda
-----

We provide experimental support for conda packages. Thus if you installed [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
you can try:
```
conda install -c https://binstar.org/twiecki zipline
```

Currently this only works for linux 64 bit. If you want to help extend this,
have a look at the `conda` subdirectory.

Quickstart
==========

The following code implements a simple dual moving average algorithm
and tests it on data extracted from yahoo finance.

```python
from zipline import TradingAlgorithm
from zipline.transforms import MovingAverage
from zipline.utils.factory import load_from_yahoo

from datetime import datetime
import pytz
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class DualMovingAverage(TradingAlgorithm):
    """Dual Moving Average Crossover algorithm.

    This algorithm buys apple once its short moving average crosses
    its long moving average (indicating upwards momentum) and sells
    its shares once the averages cross again (indicating downwards
    momentum).

    """
    def initialize(self, short_window=100, long_window=400):
        # Add 2 mavg transforms, one with a long window, one
        # with a short window.
        self.add_transform(MovingAverage, 'short_mavg', ['price'],
                           window_length=short_window)

        self.add_transform(MovingAverage, 'long_mavg', ['price'],
                           window_length=long_window)

        # To keep track of whether we invested in the stock or not
        self.invested = False

    def handle_data(self, data):
        short_mavg = data['AAPL'].short_mavg['price']
        long_mavg = data['AAPL'].long_mavg['price']
        buy = False
        sell = False

	# Has short mavg crossed long mavg?
        if short_mavg > long_mavg and not self.invested:
            self.order('AAPL', 100)
            self.invested = True
            buy = True
        elif short_mavg < long_mavg and self.invested:
            self.order('AAPL', -100)
            self.invested = False
            sell = True

	# Record state variables. A column for each
	# variable will be added to the performance
	# DataFrame returned by .run()
        self.record(short_mavg=short_mavg,
                    long_mavg=long_mavg,
                    buy=buy,
                    sell=sell)

# Load data
start = datetime(1990, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, pytz.utc)
end = datetime(2002, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, pytz.utc)
data = load_from_yahoo(stocks=['AAPL'], indexes={}, start=start,
       		       end=end, adjusted=False)

# Run algorithm
dma = DualMovingAverage()
perf = dma.run(data)

# Plot results
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(211,  ylabel='Price in $')
data['AAPL'].plot(ax=ax1, color='r', lw=2.)
perf[['short_mavg', 'long_mavg']].plot(ax=ax1, lw=2.)

ax1.plot(perf.ix[perf.buy].index, perf.short_mavg[perf.buy],
         '^', markersize=10, color='m')
ax1.plot(perf.ix[perf.sell].index, perf.short_mavg[perf.sell],
         'v', markersize=10, color='k')

ax2 = fig.add_subplot(212, ylabel='Portfolio value in $')
perf.portfolio_value.plot(ax=ax2, lw=2.)

ax2.plot(perf.ix[perf.buy].index, perf.portfolio_value[perf.buy],
         '^', markersize=10, color='m')
ax2.plot(perf.ix[perf.sell].index, perf.portfolio_value[perf.sell],
         'v', markersize=10, color='k')
```

Development Environment
-----------------------

The following guide assumes your system has [virtualenvwrapper](https://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper)
and [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) already installed.

You'll need to install some C library dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran

wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
tar -xvzf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
cd ta-lib/
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
```

Suggested installation of Python library dependencies used for development:

```
mkvirtualenv zipline
./etc/ordered_pip.sh ./etc/requirements.txt
pip install -r ./etc/requirements_dev.txt
```

Style Guide
------------

To ensure that changes and patches are focused on behavior changes,
the zipline codebase adheres to both PEP-8,
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>, and pyflakes,
<https://launchpad.net/pyflakes/>.

The maintainers check the code using the flake8 script,
<https://bitbucket.org/tarek/flake8/wiki/Home>, which is included in the
requirements_dev.txt.

Before submitting patches or pull requests, please ensure that your
changes pass ```flake8 zipline tests``` and ```nosetests```
