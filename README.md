Powerline
=======


Powerline is a Pythonic algorithmic trading library based on the [Zipline Library](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline).  The system is
fundamentally event-driven and a close approximation of how
live-trading systems operate.

Zipline is currently used in production as the backtesting engine
powering Quantopian (https://www.quantopian.com) -- a free,
community-centered platform that allows development and real-time
backtesting of trading algorithms in the web browser.
