    Generator-style class that takes the expected output of a merge, a
    user algorithm, a trading environment, and a simulator slippage as
    arguments.  Pipes the merge stream through a TransactionSimulator
    and a PerformanceTracker, which keep track of the current state of
    our algorithm's simulated universe. Results are fed to the user's
    algorithm, which directly inserts transactions into the
    TransactionSimulator's order book.

    TransactionSimulator maintains a dictionary from sids to the
    as-yet unfilled orders placed by the user's algorithm.  As trade
    events arrive, if the algorithm has open orders against the
    trade's sid, the simulator will fill orders up to 25% of market
    cap.  Applied transactions are added to a txn field on the event
    and forwarded to PerformanceTracker. The txn field is set to None
    on non-trade events and events that do not match any open orders.

    PerformanceTracker receives the updated event messages from
    TransactionSimulator, maintaining a set of daily and cumulative
    performance metrics for the algorithm.  The tracker removes the
    txn field from each event it receives, replacing it with a
    portfolio field to be fed into the user algo. At the end of each
    trading day, the PerformanceTracker also generates a daily
    performance report, which is appended to event's perf_report
    field.

    Fully processed events are fed to AlgorithmSimulator, which
    batches together events with the same dt field into a single
    snapshot to be fed to the algo. The portfolio object is repeatedly
    overwritten so that only the most recent snapshot of the universe
    is sent to the algo.
