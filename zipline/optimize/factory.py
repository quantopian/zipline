    can be changed by setting config['algorithm'].

    :Arguments:
        offset : int (default 0)
            The offset parameter specifies how much the BuySellAlgorithm will
            order each iteration and is a negative quadratic centered around
            0. Thus, any deviations from 0 will lead to less buy and sell
            orders each iteration and ultimately to less compound returns.
