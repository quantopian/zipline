    There are two ways to create a new batch window:
    (i) Inherit from BatchTransform and overload get_value(data).
        E.g.:
        ```
        class MyBatchTransform(BatchTransform):
            def get_value(self, data):
               # compute difference between the means of sid 0 and sid 1
               return data[0].mean() - data[1].mean()
        ```

    (ii) Use the batch_transform decorator.
        E.g.:
        ```
        @batch_transform
        def my_batch_transform(data):
            return data[0].mean() - data[1].mean()

        ```

    In you algorithm you would then have to instantiate
    this in the initialize() method:
    ```
    self.my_batch_transform = MyBatchTransform()
    ```

    To then use it, inside of the algorithm handle_data(), call the
    handle_data() of the BatchTransform and pass it the current event:
    ```
    result = self.my_batch_transform(data)
