    Base class for objects that can appear in the compute graph of a

    Notes
    -----
    Most Pipeline API users only interact with :class:`Term` via subclasses:

    - :class:`~zipline.pipeline.data.BoundColumn`
    - :class:`~zipline.pipeline.Factor`
    - :class:`~zipline.pipeline.Filter`
    - :class:`~zipline.pipeline.Classifier`

    Instances of :class:`Term` are **memoized**. If you call a Term's
    constructor with the same arguments twice, the same object will be returned
    from both calls:

    **Example:**

    >>> from zipline.pipeline.data import EquityPricing
    >>> from zipline.pipeline.factors import SimpleMovingAverage
    >>> x = SimpleMovingAverage(inputs=[EquityPricing.close], window_length=5)
    >>> y = SimpleMovingAverage(inputs=[EquityPricing.close], window_length=5)
    >>> x is y
    True

    .. warning::

       Memoization of terms means that it's generally unsafe to modify
       attributes of a term after construction.

        **Filling with a Term:**

        Let ``f`` be as above, and let ``g`` be another Factor which would
        produce the following output::

                         AAPL   MSFT    MCD     BK
