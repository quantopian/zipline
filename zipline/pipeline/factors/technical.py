    Note
    ----
    Computing this factor over many assets can be time consuming. It is
    recommended that a mask be used in order to limit the number of assets over
    which correlations are computed.

    Example
    -------
    Let the following be example 10-day returns for three different assets::

                       SPY    MSFT     FB
        2017-03-13    -.03     .03    .04
        2017-03-14    -.02    -.03    .02
        2017-03-15    -.01     .02    .01
        2017-03-16       0    -.02    .01
        2017-03-17     .01     .04   -.01
        2017-03-20     .02    -.03   -.02
        2017-03-21     .03     .01   -.02
        2017-03-22     .04    -.02   -.02

    Suppose we are interested in SPY's rolling returns correlation with each
    stock from 2017-03-17 to 2017-03-22, using a 5-day look back window (that
    is, we calculate each correlation coefficient over 5 days of data). We can
    achieve this by doing::

        rolling_correlations = RollingPearsonOfReturns(
            target=Equity(8554),
            returns_length=10,
            correlation_length=5,
        )

    The result of computing ``rolling_correlations`` from 2017-03-17 to
    2017-03-22 gives::

                       SPY   MSFT     FB
        2017-03-17       1    .15   -.96
        2017-03-20       1    .10   -.96
        2017-03-21       1   -.16   -.94
        2017-03-22       1   -.16   -.85

    Note that the column for SPY is all 1's, as the correlation of any data
    series with itself is always 1. To understand how each of the other values
    were calculated, take for example the .15 in MSFT's column. This is the
    correlation coefficient between SPY's returns looking back from 2017-03-17
    (-.03, -.02, -.01, 0, .01) and MSFT's returns (.03, -.03, .02, -.02, .04).

    Notes
    -----
    Computing this factor over many assets can be time consuming. It is
    recommended that a mask be used in order to limit the number of assets over
    which regressions are computed.

    This factor is designed to return five outputs:

    - alpha, a factor that computes the intercepts of each regression.
    - beta, a factor that computes the slopes of each regression.
    - r_value, a factor that computes the correlation coefficient of each
      regression.
    - p_value, a factor that computes, for each regression, the two-sided
      p-value for a hypothesis test whose null hypothesis is that the slope is
      zero.
    - stderr, a factor that computes the standard error of the estimate of each
      regression.

    For more help on factors with multiple outputs, see
    :class:`zipline.pipeline.factors.CustomFactor`.

    Example
    -------
    Let the following be example 10-day returns for three different assets::

                       SPY    MSFT     FB
        2017-03-13    -.03     .03    .04
        2017-03-14    -.02    -.03    .02

        2017-03-22     .04    -.02   -.02

    Suppose we are interested in predicting each stock's returns from SPY's
    over rolling 5-day look back windows. We can compute rolling regression
    coefficients (alpha and beta) from 2017-03-17 to 2017-03-22 by doing::

        regression_factor = RollingRegressionOfReturns(
            target=Equity(8554),
            returns_length=10,
            regression_length=5,
        )
        alpha = regression_factor.alpha
        beta = regression_factor.beta

    The result of computing ``alpha`` from 2017-03-17 to 2017-03-22 gives::

                       SPY    MSFT     FB
        2017-03-17       0    .011   .003
        2017-03-20       0   -.004   .004
        2017-03-21       0    .007   .006
        2017-03-22       0    .002   .008

    And the result of computing ``beta`` from 2017-03-17 to 2017-03-22 gives::

                       SPY    MSFT     FB
        2017-03-17       1      .3   -1.1
        2017-03-20       1      .2     -1
        2017-03-21       1     -.3     -1
        2017-03-22       1     -.3    -.9

    Note that SPY's column for alpha is all 0's and for beta is all 1's, as the
    regression line of SPY with itself is simply the function y = x.

    To understand how each of the other values were calculated, take for
    example MSFT's ``alpha`` and ``beta`` values on 2017-03-17 (.011 and .3,
    respectively). These values are the result of running a linear regression
    predicting MSFT's returns from SPY's returns, using values starting at
    2017-03-17 and looking back 5 days. That is, the regression was run with
    x = [-.03, -.02, -.01, 0, .01] and y = [.03, -.03, .02, -.02, .04], and it
    produced a slope of .3 and an intercept of .011.
