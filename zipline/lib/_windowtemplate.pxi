    An iterator representing a moving view over an AdjustedArray.

    Concrete subtypes should subclass this and provide a `data` attribute for
    specific types.

    This object stores a copy of the data from the AdjustedArray over which
    it's iterating.  At each step in the iteration, it mutates its copy to
    allow us to show different data when looking back over the array.

    The arrays yielded by this iterator are always views over the underlying
    data.
