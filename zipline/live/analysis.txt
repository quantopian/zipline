DataPortal: "Interface to all of the data that a zipline simulation needs."
DataPortal's methods used in TradingAlgorithm
line 586: used to create a trading_client (AlgorithmSimulatior)
line 625: get a list of all the assets in the trading universe
line 975: fetch_csv, data from external csv is added to DataPortal.  
line 1566 & 1580: tracks portfolio positions
line 2099: get historical data

Blotter is the class for placing orders
Blotter's methods used in TradingAlgorithm
line 1421: used to order assets in order()
line 1480 & 1439: limit & stop orders
line 1647: set slippage model, may not be needed for live trading
line 1692: order cancellation policy
line 2010: batch order
line 2060, 2061, 2076 : submit orders, cancel orders

AlgorithmSimulator (in zipline/gens/tradesimulation.py)
used as the trading_client in TradingAlgorithm, the trading_client has methods/attributes called in the following places
 in TradingAlgorithm:
line 593: transform(), creates a generator work loop for TradingAlgorithm._create_generator()
line 1321: current_data.current(asset, "price") used to get the last price of asset
line 1477: current_data used to validate_order_params
line 2153: current_data used in validate_account_controls

Other notes:
TradingAlgorithm.on_dt_changed() is called by the simulation loop, this would need to be called by something similar to
simulation.
Blotter and DataPortal both need to access the broker.  Data comes in through DataPortal and out through Blotter.
We should create an abstract class called: Broker, (perhaps a Singleton) that both DataPortal and Blotter will have
access to.  (Perhaps others will need access as well.)  The IB specific code will be placed in IBBroker which inherits
from Broker.
