class BcolzOHLCVReader(object):
    """
    Returns the raw pricing information using a bcolz table.

    The bcolz table that backs this loader contains the following columns
    and attributes.

    Columns:

    - open, an integer column which is the price * 1000

    - high, an integer column which is the price * 1000

    - low, an integer column which is the price * 1000

    - close, an integer column which is the price * 1000

    - volume, an integer column of the volume price information unchanged.

    - sid, an integer column reperesting the asset id (unused by loader)

    - day, an integer column of the midnight of the day the row in seconds
    since epoch. (unused by loader)

    The data in each column is grouped by asset and then sorted by day within
    each asset block.

    The table is built to represent a long time range of data, e.g. ten years
    of equity data, so the lengths of each asset block is not equal to each
    other. The blocks are clipped to the known start and end date of each
    asset, to cut down on the number of empty values that would need to be
    included to make a regular/cubic dataset.

    When read across the open, high, low, close, and volume with the same
    index should represent the same asset and day.

    Attributes:

    - start_pos, a dictionary keyed by asset id of the index of the first row
    of each asset, used as the basis for finding the start index with which
    to read the data from the table.

    - start_day_offset, the number of days since the start date of the entire
    dataset that the individual equity starts, used with the start_pos to
    determine the index from which to start reading data.

    - end_day_offset, the number of days since the end date of the entire that
    the individual equity ends at, used to prevent the indexing logic from
    including values from the next block of data.
