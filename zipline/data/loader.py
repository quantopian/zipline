    Load benchmark returns and treasury yield curves for the given calendar and
    benchmark symbol.

    Benchmarks are downloaded as a Series from Google Finance.  Treasury curves
    are US Treasury Bond rates and are downloaded from 'www.federalreserve.gov'
    by default.  For Canadian exchanges, a loader for Canadian bonds from the
    Bank of Canada is also available.

    Results downloaded from the internet are cached in
    ~/.zipline/data. Subsequent loads will attempt to read from the cached
    files before falling back to redownload.

    Parameters
    ----------
    trading_day : pandas.CustomBusinessDay, optional
        A trading_day used to determine the latest day for which we
        expect to have data.  Defaults to an NYSE trading day.
    trading_days : pd.DatetimeIndex, optional
        A calendar of trading days.  Also used for determining what cached
        dates we should expect to have cached. Defaults to the NYSE calendar.
    bm_symbol : str, optional
        Symbol for the benchmark index to load.  Defaults to 'SPY', the Google
        ticker for the S&P 500.
