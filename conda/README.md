conda build files
=================

[conda](http://docs.continuum.io/conda/intro.html) is a 
Python package management system by Continuum that provides
easy installation of binary packages.

The files in this directory provide instructions for how 
to create these binary packages. After installing conda and 
conda-build you should be able to:

```
conda build ta-lib
conda build logbook
conda build zipline
```

You can then upload these binary packages to your own
channel at [binstar](https://binstar.org).

Note that we currently don't have binary packages for
some platforms so if you successfully build them on anything
we don't provide at [https://binstar.org/twiecki](https://binstar.org/twiecki)
please let us know (especially windows).
