Highlights

None

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added new datasets
  :class:`~zipline.pipeline.data.buyback_auth.CashBuybackAuthorizations`
  and :class:`~zipline.pipeline.data.buyback_auth.ShareBuybackAuthorizations`
  for use in the Pipeline API.  These datasets provide an abstract interface for
  adding cash and share buyback authorizations data, respectively, to a new
  algorithm. pandas-based reference implementations for these datasets can be
  found in :mod:`zipline.pipeline.loaders.buyback_auth`, and experimental
  blaze-based implementations can be found in
  :mod:`zipline.pipeline.loaders.blaze.buyback_auth`. (:issue:`1022`).

* Added new built-in factors,
  :class:`zipline.pipeline.factors.BusinessDaysSinceCashBuybackAuth` and
  :class:`zipline.pipeline.factors.BusinessDaysSinceShareBuybackAuth`.  These
  factors use the new ``CashBuybackAuthorizations`` and
  ``ShareBuybackAuthorizations`` datasets, respectively. (:issue:`1022`).

* Added factor normalization methods:
  :meth:`zipline.pipeline.Factor.demean` and
  :meth:`zipline.pipeline.Factor.zscore`. (:issue:`1046`)

* Implemented :class:`zipline.pipeline.Classifier`, a new core pipeline API
  term representing grouping keys.  Classifiers are primarily used by passing
  them as the ``groupby`` parameter to factor normalization methods.

* Adds :class:`~zipline.testing.fixtures.ZiplineTestCase` which provides hooks
  to consume test fixtures. Fixtures are things like:
  :class:`~zipline.testing.fixtures.WithAssetFinder` which will make
  ``self.asset_finder`` available to your test with some mock data
  (:issue:`1042`).
