Release 1.0.1
-------------

:Release: 1.0.1
:Date: May 27, 2016

This is a minor bug-fix release from 1.0.0 and includes a small number of bug
fixes and documentation improvements.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for user-defined commission models. See the
  :class:`zipline.finance.commission.CommissionModel` class for more details on
  implementing a commision model. (:issue:`1213`)

- Added support for non-float columns to Blaze-backed Pipeline
  datasets (:issue:`1201`).

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug where Pipeline loaders were not properly initialized by
  :func:`zipline.run_algorithm`.  This also affected invocations of ``zipline
  run`` from the CLI.

- Fixed a bug that caused the ``%%zipline`` IPython cell magic to fail
  (:commit:`533233fae43c7ff74abfb0044f046978817cb4e4`).

- Fixed a bug in the :class:`~zipline.finance.commission.PerTrade` commission
  model where commissions were incorrectly applied to each partial-fill of an
  order rather than on the order itself, resulting in algorithms being charged
  too much in commissions when placing large orders.

  :class:`~zipline.finance.commission.PerTrade` now correctly applies
  commissions on a per-order basis (:issue:`1213`).

- Attribute accesses on :class:`CustomFactors <zipline.pipeline.CustomFactor>`
  defining multiple outputs will now correctly return an output slice when the
  output is also the name of a :class:`~zipline.pipeline.factors.Factor` method
  (:issue:`1214`).

- Replaced deprecated usage of ``pandas.io.data`` with ``pandas_datareader``
  (:issue:`1218`).

- Fixed an issue where ``.pyi`` stub files for :mod:`zipline.api` were
  accidentally excluded from the PyPI source distribution.  Conda users should
  be unaffected (:issue:`1230`).

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a new example, :mod:`zipline.examples.momentum_pipeline`, which
  exercises the Pipeline API (:issue:`1230`).
