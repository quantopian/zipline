Release 0.8.4
-------------

:Release: 0.8.4
:Date: TBD

Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~

None

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adds a way for users to specify context manager to use when executing the
  scheduled functions (including ``handle_data``). This context manager will be
  passed the :class:`~zipline.protocol.BarData` object for the bar and will
  be used for the duration of all of the functions scheduled to run. This can be
  passed to :class:`~zipline.algorithm.TradingAlgorithm` by the keyword argument
  ``create_event_context`` (:issue:`828`).

Experimental Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Experimental features are subject to change.

None

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixes an issue that would cause the daily/minutely method caching to change
  the ``len`` of a :class:`~zipline.protocol.SIDData` object. This would cause
  us to think that the object was not empty even when it was (:issue:`826`).

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Speeds up `AssetFinder.lookup_symbol` by adding an extension, 
`AssetFinderCachedEquities`, that loads equities into dictionaries and
then directs `lookup_symbol` to these dictionaries to find matching equities
 (:issue:`830`).

Maintenance and Refactorings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Asset databases now contain version information to ensure compatibility
  with current Zipline version (:issue:`815`).

Build
~~~~~

* Makes zipline install requirements more flexible (:issue:`825`).
* Use ``versioneer`` to manage the project ``__version__`` and setup.py version
  (:issue:`829`).

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Document the release process for developers (:issue:`835`).

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adds :func:`~zipline.utils.test_utils.subtest` decorator for creating subtests
  without ``nose_parameterized.expand`` which bloats the test output
  (:issue:`833`).
