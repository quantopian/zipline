Highlights

None

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adds a way for users to specify context manager to use when executing the
  scheduled functions (including ``handle_data``). This context manager will be
  passed the :class:`~zipline.protocol.BarData` object for the bar and will
  be used for the duration of all of the functions scheduled to run. This can be
  passed to :class:`~zipline.algorithm.TradingAlgorithm` by the keyword argument
  ``create_event_context`` (:issue:`828`).

Experimental Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Experimental features are subject to change.

None

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixes an issue that would cause the daily/minutely method caching to change
  the ``len`` of a :class:`~zipline.protocol.SIDData` object. This would cause
  us to think that the object was not empty even when it was (:issue:`826`).
