:Release: 1.2.0
:Date: TBD

Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~

Extensible Risk and Performance Metrics (:issue:`2081`)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The risk and performance metrics are summarizing values calculated by Zipline
when running a simulation, for example: returns or Sharpe ratio. 1.1.2
introduces a new API for registering custom risk and performance metrics defined
by the user. We have also made it possible to run a backtest without computing
any metrics to improve the feedback cycle when debugging an algorithm.

For more information, see :ref:`metrics`.

Docs, Trading Calendars, and Benchmarks
```````````````````````````````````````
Zipline now defaults to using the ``quandl`` bundle, which you'll need an API Key for, and can find information about in the Data Bundles documentation.

We've added many Tutorial & Documentations updates, including information on how to create your own ``TradingCalendar``, pass it to your algorithm via the Zipline CLI, and how to use custom csv data using the ``csvdir`` bundle.

Zipline is no longer being tested and packaged for Python 3.4.

Zipline now requests data for SPY, the default benchmark used for Zipline backtests, using the `IEX Trading <https://iextrading.com>`__ API, and no longer uses ``pandas-datareader``. You can run a backtest up to 5 years from the current day using this data.
