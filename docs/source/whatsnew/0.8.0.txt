Release 0.8.0
-------------

:Release: 0.8.0
:Date: TBD

Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~

* New documentation system with a new website at
  `zipline.io <http://www.zipline.io>`__
* Major performance enhancements.
* Dynamic history.
* New user defined method: ``before_trading_start``.
* New api function: ``schedule_function``.
* Pipeline API.
* Support for trading futures.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Account object: Adds an account object to conext to track information about
  the trading account.
  Example:

  .. code-block:: python

     context.account.settled_cash

  Returns the settled cash value that is stored on the account object.
  This value is updated accordingly as the algorithm is run (:issue:`396`).
* :class:`~zipline.history.history_container.HistoryContainer` can now grow
  dynamically.  Calls to :func:`~zipline.api.history` will now be able to increase
  the size or change the shape of the history container to be able to service the
  call. :func:`~zipline.api.add_history` now acts as a preformance hint to
  pre-allocate sufficient space in the container. This change is backwards
  compatible with ``history``, all existing algorithms should continue to work as
  intended (:issue:`412`).
* Simple transforms ported from quantopian and use history.
  :class:`~zipline.protocol.SIDData` now has methods for:

  -  ``stddev``
  -  ``mavg``
  -  ``vwap``
  -  ``returns``

  These methods, except for ``returns``, accept a number of days. If
  you are running with minute data, then this will calculate the
  number of minutes in those days, accounting for early closes and the
  current time and apply the transform over the set of minutes.
  ``returns`` takes no parameters and will return the daily returns of
  the given asset.
  Example:

  .. code:: python

     data[security].stddev(3)

  (:issue:`429`).
* New fields in Performance Period.
  Performance Period has new fields accessible in return value of
  ``to_dict``:
  -  gross leverage
  -  net leverage
  -  short exposure
  -  long exposure
  -  shorts count
  -  longs count
  (:issue:`464`).
* Allow :func:`~zipline.api.order_percent` to work with various market values
  (by Jeremiah Lowin).

  Currently, :func:`~zipline.api.order_percent` and
  :func:`~zipline.api.order_target_percent` both operate as a percentage of
  ``self.portfolio.portfolio_value``. This PR lets them operate as percentages
  of other important MVs.
  Also adds ``context.get_market_value()``, which enables this
  functionality.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: python

     # this is how it works today (and this still works)
     # put 50% of my portfolio in AAPL
     order_percent('AAPL', 0.5)
     # note that if this were a fully invested portfolio, it would become 150% levered.

     # take half of my available cash and buy AAPL
     order_percent('AAPL', 0.5, percent_of='cash')

     # rebalance my short position, as a percentage of my current short
     book_target_percent('MSFT', 0.1, percent_of='shorts')

     # rebalance within a custom group of stocks
     tech_stocks = ('AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL')
     tech_filter = lambda p: p.sid in tech_stocks
     for stock in tech_stocks:
         order_target_percent(stock, 1/3, percent_of_fn=tech_filter)

  (:issue:`477`).
* Command line option to for printing algo to stdout (by Andrea D'Amore)
  (:issue:`545`).
* New user defined function ``before_trading_start``. This function can be
  overridden by the user to be called once before the market opens every
  day (:issue:`389`).
* New api function :func:`~zipline.api.schedule_function`. This function allows
  the user to schedule a function to be called based on more complicated rules
  about the date and time. For example, call the function 15 minutes before
  market close respecting early closes (:issue:`411`).
* Adds a list of leveraged ETFs and a waay to mark a 'do not trade' set of
  assets (:issue:`478`).
* Adds a class for representing securities. :func:`~zipline.api.order` and other
  order functions now require an instance of ``Security``
  instead of an int or string (:issue:`520`).
* Generalize the ``Security`` class to :class:`~zipline.assets.Asset`. This is
  in preperation of adding support for other asset types (:issue:`535`).


Experimental Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Experimental features are subject to change.

* Adds new Pipeline API. The pipeline AAPI is a high-level declarative API for
  representing trailing window computaions on large datasets (:issue:`630`).
* Adds support for futures trading (:issue:`637`).
* Adds Pipeline loader for blaze expressions. This allows users to pull data
  from any format blaze understands and use it in the Pipeline
  API. (:issue:`775`).

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fix a bug where the reported returns could sharply dip for random periods of
  time (:issue:`378`).
* Fix a bug that prevented debuggers from resolving the algorithm file
  (:issue:`431`).
* Properly forward arguments to user defined ``initialize`` function
  (:issue:`687`).
* Fix a bug that would cause treasury data to be redownloaded every backtest
  between midnight EST and the time when the treasury data was available
  (:issue:`793`).
* Fix a bug that would cause the user defined ``analyze`` function to not be
  called if it was passed as a keyword argument to
  :class:`~zipline.algorithm.TradingAlgorithm` (:issue:`819`).

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Major performance enhancements to history (by Dale Jung) (:issue:`488`).

Maintenance and Refactorings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Remove simple transform code. These are available as methods of
  :class:`~zipline.protocol.SIDData` (:issue:`550`).

Build
~~~~~

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Switched to sphinx for the documentation (:issue:`816`).
