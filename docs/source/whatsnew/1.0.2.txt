Release 1.0.2
-------------

:Release: 1.0.2
:Date: TBD

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds forward fill checkpoint tables for the blaze core loader. This allow the
  loader to more efficiently forward fill the data by capping the lower date it
  must search for when querying data. The checkpoints should have novel deltas
  applied (:issue:`1276`).

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Changes :class:`~zipline.pipeline.factors.AverageDollarVolume` built-in
  factor to treat missing close or volume values as 0. Previously, NaNs were
  simply discarded before averaging, giving the remaining values too much
  weight (:issue:`1309`).
