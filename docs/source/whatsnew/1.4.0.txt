Maintenance
-----------

| MAINT Correcting merge issue `samatix <https://github.com/samatix>`__
| MAINT If no benchmark file, symbol or zero returns is chosen and no
  benchmark data is ingested, we check if the IEX_API_CLOUD is defined
  in the env variable. If the later is not provided, we raise an error
  that is caught in the loader file and None returns are sent back to
  the run_algo function. if context.set_benchmark(symbol(’‘)) is used,
  the system proceeds with no issue otherwise the program ends up with a
  ValueError benchmark not provided. Removing the warnings from the
  **main** script and putting at the level of the loader functions
  `samatix <https://github.com/samatix>`__
  MAINT Using returns instead of OHLCV data when the benchmark file is
  provided (–benchmark-file is given). The format is as follow: date,
