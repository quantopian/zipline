DataSetFamily
`````````````

 Dataset families are used to represent data where the unique identifier for
 a row requires more than just asset and date coordinates. A
 :class:`zipline.pipeline.data.DataSetFamily` can also be thought of as a collection of
 :class:`~zipline.pipeline.data.DataSet` objects, each of which has the same
 columns, domain, and ndim.

 :class:`zipline.pipeline.data.DataSetFamily` objects are defined with one or more
 :class:`~zipline.pipeline.data.Column` objects, plus one additional field:
 ``extra_dims``.

 The ``extra_dims`` field defines coordinates other than asset and date that
 must be fixed to produce a logical timeseries. The column objects determine
 columns that will be shared by slices of the family.

 ``extra_dims`` are represented as an ordered dictionary where the keys are
 the dimension name, and the values are a set of unique values along that
 dimension.

 To work with a :class:`zipline.pipeline.data.DataSetFamily` in a pipeline expression, one must
 choose a specific value for each of the extra dimensions using the
 :meth:`~zipline.pipeline.data.DataSetFamily.slice` method.
 For example, given a :class:`zipline.pipeline.data.DataSetFamily`:

 .. code-block:: python

    class SomeDataSet(DataSetFamily):
        extra_dims = [
            ('dimension_0', {'a', 'b', 'c'}),
            ('dimension_1', {'d', 'e', 'f'}),
        ]

        column_0 = Column(float)
        column_1 = Column(bool)

 This dataset might represent a table with the following columns:

 ::

   sid :: int64
   asof_date :: datetime64[ns]
   timestamp :: datetime64[ns]
   dimension_0 :: str
   dimension_1 :: str
   column_0 :: float64
   column_1 :: bool

 Here we see the implicit ``sid``, ``asof_date`` and ``timestamp`` columns
 as well as the extra dimensions columns.

 This :class:`zipline.pipeline.data.DataSetFamily` can be converted to a regular :class:`zipline.pipeline.data.DataSet`
 with:

 .. code-block:: python

    DataSetSlice = SomeDataSet.slice(dimension_0='a', dimension_1='e')

 This sliced dataset represents the rows from the higher dimensional dataset
 where ``(dimension_0 == 'a') & (dimension_1 == 'e')``.

New Built In Factors
````````````````````

- ``PercentChange``: Calculates the percent change over the given
  ``window_length``. Note: Percent change is calculated as
  ``(new - old) / abs(old)``. (:issue:`2506`)
- ``PeerCount``: gives the number of occurrences of each distinct
  category in a classifier (:issue:`2509`)
- :class:`~zipline.pipeline.mixins.ConstantMixin`: A mixin for creating a Pipeline term with a constant value. (:issue:`2697`)
- :meth:`~zipline.pipeline.filters.Filter.if_else`: Allows users to create expressions that conditionally draw from the outputs of one of two terms. (:issue:`2697`)
- :meth:`~zipline.pipeline.term.ComputableTerm.fillna`: Allows users to fill missing data with either a constant value, or values from another term. (:issue:`2697`)
- :meth:`~zipline.pipeline.factors.Factor.clip`: Allows users to constrain a factor's values to a given range. (:issue:`2708`)

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added International Pipelines (:issue:`2262`)
- Added DataSetFamily (ne MultiDimensionalDataSet) - a shorthand for creating a collection of regular DataSets that share the same columns. (:issue:`2402`)
- Added ``DataSet.get_column`` for looking up columns by name (:issue:`2210`)
- Added ``CheckWindowsClassifier`` allows us to test lookback windows of
  categorical and string columns using pipeline. (:issue:`2458`)
- Added ``PipelineHooks`` which is now used to display Pipline progress
  bars (:issue:`2467`)
- ``BoundColumn`` comparisons will now result in an error. This prevents
  writing ``EquityPricing.volume > 1000`` (silently returning bad data)
  insteads of ``EquityPricing.volume.latest > 1000``. (:issue:`2537`)
- Added currency conversion support to Pipeline. (:issue:`2586`)
- Added ``--benchmark-file`` and ``--benchmark-symbol`` command line arguments to make it easier to provide benchmark data. (:issue:`2642`)
- Added support for Python 3.6 (:issue:`2643`)
- Added ``mask`` argument to Factor.peer_count. (:issue:`2676`)
- Added :meth:`~zipline.pipeline.filters.Filter.if_else` and :meth:`~zipline.pipeline.term.ComputableTerm.fillna` for allowing conditional logic in Pipelines. (:issue:`2691`)
- Added daily summary methods to Factor for collecting summary statistics for the entire universe. (:issue:`2697`)
- Added :meth:`~zipline.pipeline.factors.Factor.clip` method for clipping values to a range. (:issue:`2708`)
- Added support for Pipeline term arithmetic with more than 32 terms. (:issue:`2727`)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed support for non unique sid->exchange mappings. (:issue:`2289`)
- Fixed crash on dividend warning (:issue:`2323`)
- Fixed ``week_start`` when Monday precedes the New Year. (:issue:`2394`)
- Ensured correct dtypes when unpacking empty dataframes. (:issue:`2444`)
- Fixed a bug where a pipeline term with ``window_length=0`` would not copy the input before calling ``compute()`` which could cause incorrect results if the input was reused in the Pipeline. (:issue:`2723`)


Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added :class:`zipline.data.hdf5_daily_bars.HDF5DailyBarWriter`, which writes daily pricing in a new format as an HDF5 file. Each OHLCV field is stored as a 2D array in a chunked HDF5 dataset, with a row per sid and a column per day. The file also supports multiple countries. Added :class:`zipline.data.hdf5_daily_bars.HDF5DailyBarReader`, which implements the BarReader interface and can read files written by HDF5DailyBarWriter. (:issue:`2295`)
- Vectorized dividend ratio calculation (:issue:`2298`)
- Improved performance of the :class:`zipline.pipeline.factors.RollingPearson` and
  :class:`zipline.pipeline.factors.RollingPearsonOfReturns` pipeline factors. (:issue:`2071`)

Maintenance and Refactorings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made ``parameter_space`` reset instance fixtures between runs (:issue:`2433`)
- Removed unused treasury curves data handling. (:issue:`2626`)
