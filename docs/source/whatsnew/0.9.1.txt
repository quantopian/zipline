Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added masking to :class:`zipline.pipeline.CustomFactor`.
  Custom factors can now be passed a Filter upon instantiation. This tells the
  factor to only compute over stocks for which the filter returns True, rather
  than always computing over the entire universe of stocks. (:issue:`1095`)

* Added :class:`zipline.utils.cache.ExpiringCache`.
  A cache which wraps entries in a :class:`zipline.utils.cache.CachedObject`,
  which manages expiration of entries based on the `dt` supplied to the `get`
  method.
