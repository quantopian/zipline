Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Implemented :class:`zipline.pipeline.factors.RecarrayFactor`, a new pipeline
  term designed to compute multiple factors at once while also keeping track of
  which factors it has already computed.

* Added optional `outputs` parameter to :class:`zipline.pipeline.CustomFactor`.
  Custom factors are now capable of computing and returning multiple outputs,
  each of which are themselves a Factor.
