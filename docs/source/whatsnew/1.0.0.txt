Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Made the data loading classes have more consistent interfaces. This includes
  the equity bar writers, adjustment writer, and asset db writer. The new
  interface is that the resource to be written to is passed at construction time
  and the data to write is provided later to the `write` method as a
  dataframe. This model allows us to pass these writer objects around as a
  resource for other classes and functions to consume (:issue:`1100`).
