    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Basics\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "Zipline is an open-source algorithmic trading simulator written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source can be found at: https://github.com/quantopian/zipline\n",
    "\n",
    "Some benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Realistic: slippage, transaction costs, order delays.\n",
    "* Stream-based: Process each event individually, avoids look-ahead bias.\n",
    "* Batteries included: Common transforms (moving average) as well as common risk calculations (Sharpe).\n",
    "* Developed and continuously updated by [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com) which provides an easy-to-use web-interface to Zipline, 10 years of minute-resolution historical US stock data, and live-trading capabilities. This tutorial is directed at users wishing to use Zipline without using Quantopian. If you instead want to get started on Quantopian, see [here](https://www.quantopian.com/faq#get-started).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you have zipline correctly installed, see the [installation instructions](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline#installation) if you haven't set up zipline yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `zipline` algorithm consists of two functions you have to define:\n",
    "* `initialize(context)`\n",
    "* `handle_data(context, data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the start of the algorithm, `zipline` calls the `initialize()` function and passes in a `context` variable. `context` is a persistent namespace for you to store variables you need to access from one algorithm iteration to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the algorithm has been initialized, `zipline` calls the `handle_data()` function once for each event. At every call, it passes the same `context` variable and an event-frame called `data` containing the current trading bar with open, high, low, and close (OHLC) prices as well as volume for each stock in your universe. For more information on these functions, see the [relevant part of the Quantopian docs](https://www.quantopian.com/help#api-toplevel)."

    "`run_algo.py` first outputs the algorithm contents. It then fetches historical price and volume data of Apple from Yahoo! finance in the desired time range, calls the `initialize()` function, and then streams the historical stock price day-by-day through `handle_data()`. After each call to `handle_data()` we instruct `zipline` to order 10 stocks of AAPL. After the call of the `order()` function, `zipline` enters the ordered stock and amount in the order book. After the `handle_data()` function has finished, `zipline` looks for any open orders and tries to fill them. If the trading volume is high enough for this stock, the order is executed after adding the commission and applying the slippage model which models the influence of your order on the stock price, so your algorithm will be charged more than just the stock price * 10. (Note, that you can also change the commission and slippage model that `zipline` uses, see the [Quantopian docs](https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-slippage) for more information).\n",

    "Note that there is also an `analyze()` function printed. `run_algo.py` will try and look for a file with the ending with `_analyze.py` and the same name of the algorithm (so `buyapple_analyze.py`) or an `analyze()` function directly in the script. If an `analyze()` function is found it will be called *after* the simulation has finished and passed in the performance `DataFrame`. (The reason for allowing specification of an `analyze()` function in a separate file is that this way `buyapple.py` remains a valid Quantopian algorithm that you can copy&paste to the platform).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a quick look at the performance `DataFrame`. For this, we use `pandas` from inside the IPython Notebook and print the first ten rows. Note that `zipline` makes heavy usage of `pandas`, especially for data input and outputting so it's worth spending some time to learn it."

This magic takes the same arguments as the command line interface described above."

    "### Working example: Dual Moving Average Cross-Over\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dual Moving Average (DMA) is a classic momentum strategy. It's probably not used by any serious trader anymore but is still very instructive. The basic idea is that we compute two rolling or moving averages (mavg) -- one with a longer window that is supposed to capture long-term trends and one shorter window that is supposed to capture short-term trends. Once the short-mavg crosses the long-mavg from below we assume that the stock price has upwards momentum and long the stock. If the short-mavg crosses from above we exit the positions as we assume the stock to go down further.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we need to have access to previous prices to implement this strategy we need a new concept: History\n",
    "\n",
    "`data.history()` is a convenience function that keeps a rolling window of data for you. The first argument is the asset or iterable of assets you're using, the second argument is the field you're looking for i.e. price, open, volume, the third argument is the number of bars, and the fourth argument is your frequency (either `'1d'` for `'1m'` but note that you need to have minute-level data for using `1m`). \n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed description of `data.history()`'s features, see the [Quantopian docs](https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-history). Let's look at the strategy which should make this clear:"

    "Although it might not be directly apparent, the power of `history` (pun intended) can not be under-estimated as most algorithms make use of prior market developments in one form or another. You could easily devise a strategy that trains a classifier with [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) which tries to predict future market movements based on past prices (note, that most of the `scikit-learn` functions require `numpy.ndarray`s rather than `pandas.DataFrame`s, so you can simply pass the underlying `ndarray` of a `DataFrame` via `.values`).\n",
